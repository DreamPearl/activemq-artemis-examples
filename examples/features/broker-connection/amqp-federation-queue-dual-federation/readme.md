# AMQP Broker Connection example with dual Federation of Queue messages

If you have not already done so, [prepare the broker distribution](../../../../README.md#getting-started) before running the example.

To run the example, simply type **mvn verify** from this directory, or **mvn -PnoServer verify** if you want to create and start the broker manually.

This example demonstrates the use of dual federation to move messages among two brokers as a consumer moves.
