# JMS Replicated Failback Static Example

If you have not already done so, [prepare the broker distribution](../../../../README.md#getting-started) before running the example.

To run the example, simply type **mvn verify** from this directory.

This example is the same as the "replicated-failback" example but with a "static" clustering configuration (i.e. not using UDP multicast).

For more information on ActiveMQ Artemis failover and HA, and clustering in general, please see the clustering section of the user manual.
