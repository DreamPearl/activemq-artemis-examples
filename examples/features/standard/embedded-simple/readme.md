# Embedded Broker with External Config Example

If you have not already done so, [prepare the broker distribution](../../../../README.md#getting-started) before running the example.

To run the example, simply type **mvn verify** from this directory.

This examples shows how to setup and run an embedded broker using ActiveMQ Artemis.

ActiveMQ Artemis was designed using POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) which means embedding ActiveMQ Artemis in your own application is as simple as instantiating a few objects.

This example uses an external configuration file (i.e. broker.xml).
