# OpenWire JMS Message Recovery Example

If you have not already done so, [prepare the broker distribution](../../../../README.md#getting-started) before running the example.

To run the example, simply type **mvn verify** from this directory.

This example will start and stop the broker within the example.

This example shows how to use send messages to a queue and having these messages recovered from the journal when the broker is restarted.
